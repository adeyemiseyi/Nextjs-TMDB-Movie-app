# Nextjs-TMDB-Movie-app

I developed the movie app using Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The app includes several features such as a home page, an about page, a search bar to find movies, a light/dark mode toggle, and individual movie pages that display titles, descriptions, thumbnails, vote counts, and more.
